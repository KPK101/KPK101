### Hi!

### About Me
I am an MS Electrical Engineering graduate from Columbia University. I specialized in Applied AI with a focus on optimizations and GPU software. I love parallel computing and have a strong interest in efficient AI using the same. 


I'm also interested in Astronomy 🔭, Art 🖌, and Tennis 🎾!
